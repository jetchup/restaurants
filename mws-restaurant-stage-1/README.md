#### _Restaurant Reviews_



### Specification

We were provided the code for a restaurant reviews website (https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1). We had to make it usable in desktop and mobile devices, make it accessible and make it work offline with a service worker.

### How to use this app

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.

3. Choose neighborhoods or cuisines from the dropdown selections, and then click on the restaurant of your liking.


### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code.
